1. The Two major new features that I have added is the star collection connected to the wall drop and a speed boost
2. Both functions can be manipulated in the player editor you can choose how many stars you need to drop the wall and you can choose how long the speed boost last and how fast the speed is
3. The stars that I have added triggers through the main player node as a win condition
4. my Stars emit a signal not only to the player node but to the wall node that blocks the player from winning

To win this game you must collect the coin at the top of the parkour there is obscacles like spikes and a wall that can only be passed once a amount of stars has been met. With this there is also helping factors, There is a mushroom jump pad that makes it possible for the player to jump High and a speed boost to help the player get to the end This file also only lauches from VScode or and outside IDE it does not lauch from godot itself I realized I had dropped in the files for first project I have updated them now
